XML is a format that is slowly fading out and being replaced by JSON, however it is still present and used mainly in old platforms.

Converting XML to CSV involves the following steps:

1. Parse the XML file.
2. Create a new CSV.
3. Add a header to the CSV file, with the fields that should be included.
4. For each xml element, extract the relevant fields and add new row to the CSV file.
